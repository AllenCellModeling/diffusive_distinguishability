This directory contains pre-calculated results, so that the user doesn't need to re-run analysis which takes a long time to run.

Each file is saved as a pickled Pandas dataframe. The filenaming scheme is DE-X_dY.pickle, where DE-X indicates that the diffusion constant is 10^(-X) and dY indicates that there are Y spatial dimensions that the trajectory explores.

Package used to generate these dataframes: ndim_homogeneous_distinguishability.py/
Function used to generate these dataframes: error_sensitivity
Dataframes can be pickled/unpickled using:
df.to_pickle(filepath)
pd.read_pickle(filepath)

Parameters used to generate these files are listed in a .txt file for each subdirectroy of this directroy.
